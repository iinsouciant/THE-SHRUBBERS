# THE-SHRUBBERS

## Project Objectives

Design and fabricate a self sustaining hydroponic growing system for an urban environment. The system will be designed for rooftop, balcony, or greenhouse use.

## Project Scope (Outdated)

This system will will utilize pumps for water flow and aeration and use a pH, conductivity, and sonar sensor to monitor the system. It will fit in a 4x4x6ft space. It will operate at 0 режC to 40 режC and handle a corrosive or windy environment.

## I/O

### MCU

Raspberry Pi 4B (2(?) GB RAM) utilizes the main file to monitor sensor data and interface with the user.

### Sensors

- [HC-SR04 Sonar sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3942 "Sonar sensor")
- [DFR0300 Gravity EC sensor](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1123.html "Analog Conductivity Sensor")
- [Gravity Analog pH sensor](https://atlas-scientific.com/kits/gravity-analog-ph-kit/ "pH kit")

All but the sonar sensor use analog signals, therefore we need to get an ADC for the RPi.

- [MCP3008](https://www.adafruit.com/product/856 "10-Bit ADC")

## User Input

- [6 tactile buttons](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1119 "Tactile button pack")

## Outputs

- 1 submerged pump (AC) to move water to the channels holding plants and through the filtration system.
- 3 peristaltic pumps (DC) to condition solution
- LCD display for UI

In console, navigate to the download location of the repository and run the package installer shell script for libraries not included in the repository itself. Note: the ones included in the repository are either created by us or modified versions of other libraries. Additionally, the `pkg_script.sh` file assumes you do not have CircuitPython installed on your Raspberry Pi prior to this and will attempt to install is after the other packages.
```
sudo sh pkg_script.sh
```

# THE-SHRUBBERS
### Project Objectives
Design and fabricate a self sustaining hydroponic growing system for an urban environment. The system will be designed for rooftop, balcony, or greenhouse use. 

### Project Scope:
This system will will utilize pumps for water flow and aeration and use a pH, conductivity, and sonar sensor to monitor the system. It will fit in a 4x4x6ft space. It will operate at 0 режC to 40 режC and handle a corrosive or windy environment.

## Sensors
Consists of 2 sonar sensors to monitor the water levels of the two tanks. The pH and conductivity sensors will be used in the main tank to observe the composition of the nutrient solution.

## Devices
- Raspberry Pi 3B (1 GB RAM) utilizes the main file to monitor sensor data and interface with the user.
- Mobile device bluetooth connectivity?

## Outputs
There are two submerged pumps to move water to the channels holding plants and through the filtration system.

## Libraries
